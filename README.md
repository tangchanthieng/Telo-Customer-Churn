# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates the critical issue of customer churn within the telecommunication sector. Recognizing that retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, this analysis aims to predict the likelihood of customers terminating their relationship with a telecommunications provider. By leveraging machine learning methodologies, both unsupervised and supervised, we re-examine the relationship between various customer attributes and their propensity to churn. This work builds upon established frameworks for churn analysis, including clustering and regression techniques.

## Introduction

Customer churn poses a significant challenge for telecommunication companies. Understanding and predicting which customers are likely to leave is crucial for developing effective retention strategies and maintaining a competitive advantage. This project aligns with previous research highlighting the substantial impact of customer attrition in the telecommunications industry. While acquiring new subscribers through marketing is important, focusing on retaining current customers offers a more efficient path to sustainable growth. The ability to accurately forecast churn allows for the implementation of targeted interventions and resource allocation, ultimately strengthening customer loyalty.

## Methodology

This analysis employs both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to explore customer churn. Drawing inspiration from methodologies outlined by Batch et al. (2021) and Fathian et al. (2016), the project investigates the connections between various customer attributes and their likelihood of churning. Specific techniques utilized may include:

* **Clustering:** To identify distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics and churn patterns.
* **Classification:** To build predictive models that can identify customers at high risk of churn based on their attributes.
* **Ensemble Methods:** To potentially enhance the accuracy and robustness of predictive models by combining the strengths of multiple algorithms.

*(Further details on the specific algorithms and implementation will be provided in subsequent documentation or code.)*

## Key Findings and Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted, the report highlights several key areas for improving customer retention and reducing churn. These recommendations are categorized for clarity:

**Product & Service Innovation:**

* **Bundle internet with streaming services:** This can increase customer stickiness by offering integrated value.
* **Offer online backup/security in premium tiers:** Providing valuable add-on services can justify higher pricing and enhance perceived value.
* **Offer free trials of protection plans:** While current sales may be low, trials could alleviate customer anxiety and potentially reduce churn related to those concerns.
* **Implement referral rewards:** Leverage network effects, particularly in high-churn cities, to incentivize retention and acquisition.

**Customer Experience (CX) Revamp:**

* **Fix internet and phone service quality:** Addressing fundamental service issues is critical. This includes infrastructure upgrades and transparent communication regarding service status (e.g., service maps, real-time updates).
* **Establish city-based CX task forces:** Replicate best practices from the 5 cities with high customer satisfaction to improve CX in other areas.
* **Implement post-signup onboarding:** Provide step-by-step guidance (via video or agent calls), especially for older or monthly-contract users, to set clear expectations.
* **Improve paperless billing opt-out:** Make opting out optional and clearly explain the benefits of paperless billing, particularly to older users.

**Payment and Refund Policy Reform:**

* **Deprioritize bank withdrawal:** Encourage card/autopay methods by offering discounts or incentives.
* **Redesign refund policy:** Address the significant revenue loss from refunds by considering options such as refund caps, loyalty-linked privileges, or staggered refund models.
* **Offer monthly GB usage insights:** Provide users with information about their data usage and offer flexible plan options, including a "smart downgrade" for underutilizing customers.

## Next Steps

Further work may involve:

* Detailed implementation plans for the recommended actions.
* Development and deployment of the churn prediction models.
* Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of implemented strategies.
* Further exploration of specific customer segments and their unique churn drivers.
